# Pretty UW Course Schedule
An improvement to viewing University of Waterloo *Schedule of Classes* pages.

## Features
* CSS styling to fonts and tables
* Each course result has its own separate table and heading (eliminates nested tables)
* Togglable table rows to show/hide course reserves
* Combined table columns for enrolment and waitlist numbers
* Dates and times rendered nicely

## Comparison

The default course schedule pages have no styling and are very ugly and cluttered. See the following comparison:
